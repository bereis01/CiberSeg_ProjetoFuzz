Christmas Builders


There was trouble in the land, all on account of Christmas. Men
stood bewildered and women were distracted, not knowing what to do.
The trouble was that Christmas had become too small. Once there was
room enough in it and to spare. Only a few of the inhabitants of the
earth brought their treasures into it. But little by little the world
learned of the beauty of Christmas until everybody, almost, wanted to
get into it, and not only into it himself, but he wanted to bring all
his relatives and friends, every one of them laden with packages and
bundles, until at last Christmas became crowded to suffocation. There
was not room to turn round. Everybody was so huddled and jostled, and
there was so much scrambling and pushing, that some people quite
lost their temper, and even in the palace of Christmas looked sour.

It seems strange that the world should be embarrassed and really
injured by a desire of people to be loving and to manifest their
love by giving gifts, and yet that is the very thing which happened.
Christmas became a breeder and disseminator of dark and ugly
feelings. It is well enough when only a few people make up their
mind to be affectionate and generous; but when everybody decides to
put on the Christmas graces on the same day of the year, the world
cannot stand the strain of so much goodness all at once expressed,
and the result is a tragedy almost as deep and dark for many hearts
as if there were no Christmas at all. For in their eagerness to keep
Christmas, men forgot the claims of brotherhood. They were so
zealous to get into the enchanted palace themselves that they forgot
all about their neighbors, who wanted to get in also.
